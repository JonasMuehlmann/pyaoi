This project provides a bunch of functions to interact with iterables, it is inspired by
the [algorithm header](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm) from the C++ standard template library (STL for
short).

Please do not expect a stable API at this point.

## Installation

```pip install pyaoi```

## How to use

All functions live in the ```pyaoi``` namespace, you can import it with ```import pyaoi``` and then call the functions
like this: ```pyaio.all_of()```

## Implemented functions

The following list shows planned functions and whether they are implemented yet. Feel free to make a PR for a listed
function's implementation. This list is subject to change at any time.
